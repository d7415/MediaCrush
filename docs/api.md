# MediaCrush API

MediaCrush offers a public API that lets you do anything you could normally do on the
public site. It returns JSON on all methods and is somewhat RESTful.


## Versioning

All API endpoints are at `/api/v{version}`. The current version is 2, so all endpoints
are scoped to `/api/v2`.

## Documentation
